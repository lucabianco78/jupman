    "## Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Python modules are simply text files having the extension **.py** (e.g. ```exercise.py```). When you were writing the code in the IDE in the previous practical, you were in fact implementing the corresponding module. \n",
    "\n",
    "As said in the previous practical, once you implemented and saved the code of the module, you can execute it by typing \n",
    "\n",
    "```python3 exercise1.py```\n",
    "\n",
    "or, in Visual Studio Code, by right clicking on the code panel and selecting **Run Python File in Terminal\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A Module A can be loaded from another module B so that B can use the functions defined in A. Remember when we used the ```sqrt``` function? It is defined in the module math. To import it and use it we indeed wrote something like:"

    "## Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Python understands very well objects, and in fact everything is an object in Python. Objects have **properties** (characteristic featuers) and **methods** (things it can do). For example, an object *car* has the *properties* model, make, color, number of doors etc., and the *methods* steer right, steer left, accelerate, break, stop, change gear,... \n",
    "According to Python official documentation: \"Objects are Python's abstraction for data. All data in a Python program is represented by objects or by relations between objects.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need to know for now is that in Python objects have an **identifier (ID)** (i.e. their name), a **type** (numbers, text, collections,...) and a **value** (the actual data represented by the objects). Once an object has been created the *identifier* and the *type* never changes, while its *value* can either change (**mutable objects**) or stay constant (**immutable objects**).\n",

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are just references to objects, in other words they are the **name** given to an object. Variables can be **assigned** to objects by using the assignment operator ```=```.\n",

The type of an object can be accessed with the function **type** and the identifier with the function **id**: "
