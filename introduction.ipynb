You do not have to worry about this for the time being, we will get to this in a later practical...\n",

This is where we need to add the things we want to monitor as the execution of the program goes. With respect to the code written above, we are interested in keeping an eye on the variables S, i and also of the expression S+i (that will give us the value of S of the next iteration). Add these three expressions in the watch panel (click on **+** to add new expressions). The watch panel should look like this:\n",

This can be done by hovering with the mouse on the left of the line number. A small reddish dot should appear, place the mouse over the correct line (e.g. the line corresponding to *S = S + 1* and click to add the breakpoint (a red dot should appear once you click).  \n",

Click one more time on the green arrow and values should update accordingly (i.e. S to 1, i to 2 and S + i to 3), another round of execution should update S to 3, i to 3 and S + i to 6. Got how this works? Variable i is increased by one each time, while S increases by i.
